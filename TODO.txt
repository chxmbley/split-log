# Thinking about it
TODO: Handle disk IO with better async
TODO: Real-world compliance with syslog, Papertrail, and Windows eventvwr ?
TODO: Work toward removing dependencies

# Gonna do it
TODO: Allow custom levels to always be logged regardless of log.level
TODO: Move specific examples to example scripts and link from README

# Written but not tested
TODO: Callbacks for logging methods (would like callback to execute no matter what)

# Sorta tested
TODO: Add support for separating priority levels for stdout and file
TODO: Add support for always firing 'entry' events when log method is called
TODO: Allow log file size limit (using 'willWriteFile' and 'writeFile' events instead)
TODO: Add events 'willWriteFile' and 'writeFile' that carry info about the file
      such as current date, file size, and changes

# Updated docs

# Ready
